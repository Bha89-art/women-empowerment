    <h2>Introduction and Context Setting</h2>
    <p>Sex education provides essential knowledge and skills to promote healthy relationships, reproductive health, and informed decision-making regarding sexuality. It equips individuals with the information they need to navigate relationships, understand their bodies, and make choices that support their well-being. By promoting respect, consent, and communication, comprehensive sex education empowers girls and young women to assert their rights and advocate for themselves.</p>
    <p>Comprehensive sex education also plays a crucial role in challenging societal norms and stereotypes that perpetuate gender-based violence and discrimination. By promoting awareness and understanding of diverse identities and experiences, sex education fosters inclusivity and creates safer, more supportive environments for everyone.</p>
